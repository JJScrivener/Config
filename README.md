# Config
These are my config files for my Arch window manager. I am using Xorg, i3 and i3blocks.
I can clone these files to setup a fresh install with the right configuration.

Copy .Xresources to ~/.Xresources

Copy i3/         to ~/.config/i3/

Copy i3blocks/   to ~/.config/i3blocks/


You will need to install fontawesome from https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/releases and copy the .ttf to /usr/share/fonts/TTF

You will also need to install ttf-dejavu, rxvt-unicode, xorg-server, xorg-backlight and feh with pacman
